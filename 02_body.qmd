## Overview

```{r}
churn_2022 <-
  churn |> 
  mutate(
    churn = 
      if_else(!is.na(date) & year(date) == 2023, FALSE, churn)
  ) |> 
  summarize(percent_churn = sum(churn) / n() * 100) |> 
  pull(percent_churn) |> 
  round(1)
```

Understanding our customer churn is essential to DemoCo's success. In 2022, our customer churn was `r churn_2022`% - leading to revenue loss of \$2.2 million. **Our 2023 goal is for customer churn to be under 10%.**

## Churn by quarter

```{r}
churn |> 
  filter(!is.na(reason)) |> 
  group_by(year = year(date), quarter = quarter(date), reason) |> 
  summarize(total_churn = sum(churn), total = n(), .groups = "drop_last") |> 
  mutate(
    year_quarter_total = sum(total),
    percent_churn = total_churn / year_quarter_total
  ) |> 
  ungroup() |>  
  filter(year == 2023 | quarter > 2) |> 
  mutate(reason = fct_reorder(reason, percent_churn, .desc = TRUE)) |> 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      glue::glue("{year} Q{quarter}"), 
      percent_churn, 
      color = reason
    )
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = reason)) +

## Purchase characteristics

```{r}
churn |>
  group_by(contract, churn) |>
  summarize(
    across(
      c(average_purchase_amount, total_transactions, last_purchase_days_ago),

  fmt_currency(columns = `Average purchase`) |> 
  fmt_integer(`Days since last purchase`) |> 
  tab_header(
    title = "Purchase characteristics by contract type and churn status"
  )
```

## Contract type

```{r}
churn |> 
  mutate(churn = fct_rev(as.factor(churn))) |> 
  ggplot(aes(contract, last_purchase_days_ago, fill = churn)) +
  geom_boxplot() +

  )
